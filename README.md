# 42 Inception Project

The **Inception** project is a system administration and virtualization exercise aimed at creating a small-scale infrastructure using Docker containers. The goal is to set up a virtualized environment that includes multiple services such as WordPress, MariaDB, Nginx, and more, all running in isolated containers.

This project focuses on understanding containerization, Docker, and basic system administration. You'll learn how to configure Dockerfiles, Docker Compose, and manage services within a virtualized environment. The infrastructure must be lightweight, secure, and efficient, mimicking a real-world deployment.

By completing this project, you'll gain hands-on experience with Docker, networking, and service orchestration, preparing you for more advanced DevOps and infrastructure challenges.
